# Ecology and age, but not genetic ancestry, predict fetal loss in a wild baboon hybrid zone (Fogel, Oduor, et al. 2022, *bioRxiv*)

### This repository includes R code for recreating the analyses and figures from Fogel, Oduor et al. 2022, *bioRxiv*(DOI XXX). These scripts include:
1. ***logistic_regression_models.R***: script for running the multivariate logistic regression model predicting fetal loss.
2. ***figures.R***: script for making main text and appendix figures.

Data from this paper and used in these scripts are available in Table S6. 

For script-related questions, please email Arielle Fogel at <afogel29@gmail.com>.

Thank you for your interest in our work!
